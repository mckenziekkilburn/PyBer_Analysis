# PyBer_Analysis
__________________________

## Overview of the Analysis
- We have been asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type(Urban, Rural, and Suburban). We were also asked to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We are conducting this analysis to discuss how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

###### Our final results show how each city type differs between one another. We can see that we are the most profitable in the Urban areas. This is were we have the most activity including:  total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.


## Summary

We can take away from our analysis these 3 things:

1. Urban cty types are the most successful in all areas. We should look more into continuing our focus there. 
2. Collectively in all three city types, in late Feb. we are collectively the most successful during this time.
3. We can conclude that we are not as successful with Rural areas as we are the other two. This could be because in rural areas, they might not be in as much of a need for this services like people in urban areas are. People in the city are more than likely to use this service than rural areas are.
